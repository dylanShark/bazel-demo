## Java Protobuf Demo Workspace

This workspace contains a build that uses the built-in [java_proto_library](https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/be/java.html#java_proto_library) rule.

This example was extracted, adapted and reduced from the [helloworld](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/tree/master/examples) example from grpc-java.
