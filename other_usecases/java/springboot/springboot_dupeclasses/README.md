###  Spring Boot with Maven Install

This Bazel workspace contains an example of the [Spring Boot rule](https://github.com/salesforce/bazel-springboot-rule).
See the rule repository for more information about the rule.

This variant uses the *maven_install* rule from the *rules_jvm_external* repo to import external dependencies.
